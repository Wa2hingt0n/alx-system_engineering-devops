# 0x14 - MySQL

## Overview

This project introduces the concept of integrating databases to web servers. It involves installing MySQL on two web servers, `web-01` and `web-02` to improve redundancy. The `web-01` server will act as the source while `web-02` will act as the replica. It also involves creating a backup of the database.
